**DSKit** contains built-in text field configurations, just pick the one you need and add it to your form, each configuration comes with a specific regular expression validation, icon, minimum and maximum number of required characters for validation. 

We can use a shortcut text field and add some custom elements after initialization, for example changing the minimum of characters for a text-filed to be valid.
