## DSBottomContainer

`DSBottomContainer` is component designed to display content at the bottom of the screen, commonly used for adding buttons or contextual information to forms and dialogs. It enhances the display by adding a top shadow and managing spacing, ensuring that the content is both visually appealing and functionally positioned.

#### Initializer:
Initializes a `DSBottomContainer` with a view builder closure that defines its content.
- Parameters:
- `content`: A closure returning the content of the container. This closure is marked with `@ViewBuilder` to allow for multiple views to be composed together.

#### Usage:
`DSBottomContainer` is typically used to anchor controls or information at the bottom of the interface, adding visual structure and focus to bottom-placed elements.
